# Project Overview
## Selected topic:
* Prediction of NBA salaries based on NBA player statistics and their team record

## Reason for selecting the topic: 
* NBA statistics are a key metric in terms of evaluating player performance and contribution, which in turn leads to their final goal of winning games and championships. In other words, generally speaking, higher performance should lead to higher statistics. Additionally, players tend to be paid based on their perceived value, which can be measured by these statistics.Our goal is to determine if we can predict the player’s salaries or salary ranges based on their statistics. 

## Description of the source of data
* Our datasets currently contain data on NBA players and their season stats. The data contains information such as their biography (i.e. name, height, weight, date of birth, birth city, birth state) as well as their NBA player statistics (i.e. position, points, assists, steals, shooting %s, etc.) 

## Questions to answer with the data
* The statistics mentioned above will be consider the ‘features’ of our Machine Learning Model. The salary will be the ‘output’. The question we will be hoping to answer is: “Can we predict a player’s salary based on their NBA statistics?”
